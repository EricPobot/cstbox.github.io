Core system
===========

Core modules of the framework provide services needed for any
application. This encompasses :

  - inter-component communication (both asynchronous messages based and remote
    procedure calls)
  - events persistence in the local storage, with services for querying and
    extracting data, and support for exchangeable underlying persistence engine
  - scheduling service, based on the system ''cron'' (which is thus required)
  - equipments network configuration management and broking
  - hardware abstraction layer (HAL), providing a plugin based architecture for
    adding the support of involved equipements
  - HTTP server providing the core engine and the plugin based architecture for implementing an extensible 
    user interface and Web services
  - flag based notification engine, allowing components to signal events to be notified to the
    rest of the application or the the end user
  - plugin based data export infrastructure, for adding inter-operability
    between the CSTBox based application and external systems.

Several complementary modules are included, providing helpers intended for
contributors and integrators, in order to make their life  easier. This
includes command line common handling features, unified logging,
