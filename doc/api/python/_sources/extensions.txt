Extensions
==========

Extensions are add-ons to the core part of the framework. They can be anything which extends the features
of the core system, such as :

- hardware support drivers
- application specific processing
- data export filters for inter-operability with external systems
- ...

Devices support extensions
--------------------------

Such extensions are special, since they have the specific role of bridging specific communication protocols with
devices with the agnostic eventing and messaging architecture used for communication in the CSTBox framework domain.
Because of this, there architecture and deployement must follow some rules (see :ref:`hal_drivers` for details).
