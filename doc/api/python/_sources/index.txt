Welcome to CSTBox framework documentation !
==========================================

.. attention::

    This documentation is currently under work, and all the modules are not
    fully documented yet.

The targeted audience of this documentation is mainly developpers and contributors. 
Although we have included explainatory introductions when relevant, you will not find
here considerations about the global architecture and concepts used by the CSTBox 
framework.

For such presentation material, please consult the general Web site located at :
