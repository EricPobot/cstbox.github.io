hal - Hardware Abstraction Layer package
========================================

This sub-package gathers all modules related to abstraction of the hardware (sensors, actuators),
by providing the adaptation layer between the proprietary dialogs at device network level and the events and messages
based agnostic inter-components communication.

It contains the foundation modules providing the base definitions allowing contributors to develop the modules
providing the abstraction of their products. These module will be deployed as modules of the
`pycstbox.hal.drivers` sub-package, and are automatically integrated in the framework thanks to
appropriate introspection mechanisms.
