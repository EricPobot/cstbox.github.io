                            <h1>Inside communications</h1>
                        </div>
                        <p class="lead">The communications inside CSTBox framework are based on a few key concepts and paradigms :</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>programing language neutral message bus</li>
                            <li>white board</li>
                            <li>explicit and extensible message format</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The combination of these base recipes allows an open and as affordable as possible
                        extension and customization process, since assembled parts can be developed in any suited
                        language.

                        <h2>Communication path</h2>

                        <p>The downstream path, from the equipments to the application, is illustrated hereafter :
                        <img src="img/cstbox-v3-downstream.png"/>
                        <p>One can see here that what we call the <i>driver</i> is responsible for translating
                        the specific data frames coming from the equipments into technology agnostic events emitted
                        on the communication bus.</p>
                        <p>On the data consumers side, the involved components listen to the traffic on the communication bus, eventually tuning 
                        them for selecting the messages related to changes of variables they are interpreted by. This filtering is based 
                        on the content of the message fields. This behaviour
                        can be seen what we do when choosing a radio station on a receiver.</p>
                        <p>The reverse path, from application to equipments, is shown in next picture :</p>
                        <img src="img/cstbox-v3-upstream.png"/>
                        <p>The drivers use the same message listening and filtering as before, to select those related to changes in the control variables pertaining to the kind of devices they manage.</p>

                        <h2>Messages format</h2>

                        <p>In order to be easily produced and analyzed, the transported messages
                        are standard strings encoded in JSON. Although a bit more costly in terms of data size and processing, this option
                        as been preferred to a binary format for the following reasons :
                        <ul>
                            <li>strings don't have the problem of bytes ordering for representing numeric values, thus relieving producers and
                            consumers to bother with this concern,</li>
                            <li>strings are human readable, which is important for us, since self-explanatory data are one of the keystones of our approach,</li>
                            <li>applications and usages targeted by the framework don't generate a high throughput of messages, and these
                            messages are generally short, so we can afford the extra size and processing needed.</li>
                            <li>JSON provides a way to serialize structured data at a very reasonable cost, unlike XML for instance,
                            and is easy to parse and process</li>
                        </ul>
                        Messages are structured as follows :
                        <style>
                            table#msg_struct td {
                                border : 1px solid;
                                padding: 2px 5px;
                                font-family: monospace;
                            }
                        </style>
                        <center>
                            <table id="msg_struct"><tr><td>timestamp</td><td>vartype</td><td>varname</td><td>data</td></tr></table>
                        </center>
                        with :
                        <dl>
                            <dt>timestamp</dt><dd>the event time stamp, in milliseconds, and relative to the standard epoch on Unix systems</dd>
                            <dt>vartype</dt><dd>the type of the variable which change is notified by the event (ex: temperature)</dd>
                            <dt>varname</dt><dd>the name of the variable</dd>
                        <dt>data</dt><dd>an message dependent payload, represented as a dictionary containing the
                        data fields key and value</dd>

                        It must be noted that some keys are pre-defined for the data part of the message :
                        <dl>

                            <dt>units</dt><dd>if relevant, units used to represent the value</dd>
                        </dl>

                        <h2>For running CSTBox</h2>

                        <p class="lead">The core part of the framework is written in Python.</p>
                        <p>Python being included in common Linux distributions, even lighter ones, 
                        you should have nothing special to do most of
                        the time, apart if you are building a Linux from scratch or using some 
                        more exotic distributions.</p>

                        <p>We have used Debian based distributions for most of the applications 
                        we have deployed in the field during the various
                        projects and experiments CSTBox has been used for, installed on nano-PC 
                        type boxes, and even on card credit size computers such as the Raspberry Pi. 
                        In some specific cases, we were constrained 
                        to use very low-end targets 
                        (field controllers for instance) running LFS or alike, but could 
                        successfully install and run the Python VM, and execute
                        CSTBox based applications without any problem.</p>

                        <h2>For developing your components</h2>

                        <p class="lead">Since our approach is implementation language agnostic, there is no mandatory dependency.
                        <p>For instance, if you only need to work with sensor data which have been stored by our included recorder,
                        you do not need any special library, since the storage is organized in a collection of pure tabulated text files.
                        Although this can sound strange, it has been proven well suited. For instance, a currently running application,
                        collecting various ambient data using sensors disseminated in a house, manages nearly 3 million records using this
                        technique, without any problem and using a reasonable storage space.</p>
                        <p>If the component you want to create will communicate with some of the ones included in the framework distribution,
                        you will need to be able to send and/or receive messages on D-Bus. Fortunately, D-Bus implementation is very portable
                        <i>(it even runs on Mac OSX and Windows)</i> and bindings exist for a lot of programming
                        languages. So you'll just have to pick and install the appropriate one.</p>
