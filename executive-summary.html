              <b>CSTBox</b> acronym stands for : <b>C</b>STB <b>S</b>ensing and <b>T</b>ele-monitoring <b>Box</b>
              <p>
              CSTBox is a global solution designed by CSTB, targeted to embedded applications based on an ambient
              instrumentation composed of disseminated devices (such as sensors, actuators), 
              and providing features such as :
              <ul>
              <li>domain specific local processing (analysis, decision taking, storage),</li>
              <li>external systems connectivity (collection server,</li>
              <li>data or results upload facility,</li>
              <li>web services providing complementary data).</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
              It deals with heterogeneous device protocols in an agnostic and neutral way
              and allows the creation of solutions using devices from different manufacturers
              and working with different communication media.

                <h1>What makes it different ?</h1>
            </div>
            <p>
            At this level, one could think that it is just <i>yet-another-home-automation-initiative</i>, as can be
            found in many flavors on the Internet, either as commercial products (eg. <a href="http://www.homeseer.com">HomeSeer</a>) or open-source projects
            (eg. <a href="http://www.openhab.org">openHAB</a>).
            <p>
            The answer is simple : <i>it is not a home automation oriented framework</i>. 
            <p>
            The initial need which led us to develop the CSTBox was far from this kind of application, and we carefully
            analysed existing solutions before initiating the project. Our key need was to produce black boxes applications,
            initially oriented to ambient assisted living <i>(see above for details)</i>, without any of these eye catchy user
            interfaces on smartphones for controlling lights and displaying temperatures or electricity consumptions. 
            <p>
            To quote what an aged volunteer who participated to one of the experiments we have conduced said : 
            <p>
            <i>"I understand. Your system is just like the alarm system of my home, but it is for me and not for the home"</i>. 
            <p>
            She could not have described it better.
            <p>
            Of course, who can do more can do less. So you can create a home automation system with CSTBox if you want, but if 
            all you want is to control you home over the net using your preferred smartphone, you'd better 
            go with one of the other options. 
            <p>
            But if you are looking for a base for your domain oriented specific application, and need to talk to a variety of
            equipments, including industrial grade ones, and be able to add your own specific features in a reusable way, 
            maybe you should consider our work ;)

              <p>
              This solution has already been applied to various domains:
              </p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Elderly Care at Home</strong>.
                      Monitoring of daily activity to detect abnormal drifts of habits, often
                      symptoms of diseases or global health degradation.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Domestic Accident Prevention</strong>.
                  Detection of potentially hazardous situations (forgotten opened tap,
                  stove left on for too long without any noticeable related activity,...).
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Nurse Assistance</strong>.
                  In hospitals and retirement houses, alert for potential situations demanding
                  attention (movements in rooms at night, accidental falls, patient wandering,...).
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Energy Use</strong>.
                  Detection of bad habits and education of occupants with regards to efficiency.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>In-situ Parameter Collection and Analysis for Scientific
                      experiments</strong>.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Usage and Behavior Detection according to Activity Models</strong>.
                  </li>

                <h1>Key objectives</h1>
              </div>
              <p>This solution has been designed with the following concerns in mind :
                <ul>
                    <li>to be embeddable in low-power devices, </li>
                    <li>to be flexible, </li>
                    <li>to be easily extensible,</li>
                    <li>to be independent from the underlying hardware, and allow transparent
                    replacement of a device by a functionally equivalent one..</li>

                <h1>The team</h1>
              </div>
              <p>The CSTBox concept has been created by the CSTB research team TIDS/IIS based at
              Sophia-Antipolis.</p>
              <p>The team develops and maintains the software framework used as the foundation layer of final
              applications. The library is regularly extended with components implementing the support of 
              hardwares or reusable services, resulting from needs of ongoing research and experimentation 
              projects. We do this to contribute in turn to the open-source community, without which we could
              never have created our framework. 
              <p>
              Aside from this, we have also designed and developed a set of wireless sensors in the past, 
              used in real-world applications based on the CSTBox. This happened because we could not find
              at that moment off the shelf products meeting our requirements. This experience provided us
              a fairly good insight of the "other side" of the problem, namely the world of sensor networks
              and alike.</p>
