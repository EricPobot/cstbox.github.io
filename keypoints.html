                The CSTBox framework allows using at the same time various devices, including
                sensors, actuators, user interaction devices,&hellip; provided by different makers and
                using different communication protocols.
                <p>
                This make possible to assemble a
                configuration taking advantage of the most suited components, whatever they
                are.
                <p>
                In addition, information collected from sensors or sent to
                actuators is defined using a neutral model, fully decoupled
                from the involved hardware. It is thus possible to swap a given
                device by a functionally equivalent one without changing
                anything to the rest of the application. Such a feature is
                based on the concept of <strong>drivers</strong>, which role is
                to translate proprietary communications to and from neutral
                ones. Supporting a new kind of device is just a matter of
                developing a component implementing the services of a driver
                and adding it to the application.

              An application is the assembly of a collection of building
              blocks, called <em>software components</em> or more simply <em>components</em>.
              <p>
              Among them, we can mention :
              <ul>
                  <li>core system level ones, which are present in all applications</li>
                  <li>general purpose services : local data logging, data upload, web application
                  server,&hellip;</li>
                  <li>administration console plugins, implementing dedicated Web based
                  user-interfaces for configuring and managing installed features</li>
                  <li>hardware abstraction layer components, aka drivers, which handle
                  the connectivity between the application and the hardware devices used
                  by the application
              </ul>
                <p>
                One key advantage of such an architecture is
                to allow subdividing complex functionalities into simple building
                blocks, easier to develop and maintain, since handling a limited
                set of concerns.
                <p>
                Another advantage of such a strong decomposition is allowing to
                swap an implementation of a given feature by another one, more
                efficient for instance, by just replacing a component by another
                one implementing the same services.

            Since an application is just an assembly of components, it is easy
            to extend its features by adding the appropriate ones.
            <p>
            Even better, one can imaging deploying the full set of components,
            covering the maximum extent of the application features, but just
            activating some of them based on configuration settings. This makes
            then possible to activate (or deactivate) features on the field,
            without having to modify installed softwares.

            Unlike many frameworks, you are not tied to a given programming language. Just use the
            one which is more suited to your needs and/or your taste.
            <p>
            The previous version of our framework was based on OSGi, and thus was 100% Java written.
            All in all, this worked quite well and we have had no special grief, but we finally draw 
            a couple of conclusions which were pointing some flaws with this orientation. 
            <ol>
            <li>You have <b>no choice but Java</b>. We are not saying that Java is not a good language, 
            but forcing contributors, users or integrators to switch to Java is too strong as a constraint. 
            OK, JNI exists and you can bind other languages with Java, but this is not as simple as 
            directly use these languages in complete freedom.
            <li>All your application is confined in a <b>single system process</b>, the one in which the
            JVM is running. This can become a weakness, since a nasty error in some application related 
            code can break the whole thing. JVM is quite robust in normal conditions, but we could experience 
            some situations where it broke.
            </ol>
            <p>
            This made us leave the OSGi world, looking for other solutions for
            inter-process message communication and remote procedure call.
            <p>
            Such a solution exists, and the expected features are provided out of the box by <b>D-Bus</b>
            which is present in many Linux distributions, including embedded ones.
            <p>
            D-Bus provides services for messages broadcasting and listening, but also for 
            inter-process method calling. One of its major advantages is that it provides this in a 
            <b>programming language agnostic and neutral way</b>, bindings being available for the vast 
            majority of languages (C, Java, Python,&hellip;) Thanks to this, a Java component will 
            be able to call services provided by a component written in Python, the involved D-Bus 
            bindings taking care of marshaling and un-marshaling in a transparent way.
            <p>
            The newest version of CSTBox has thus been rewritten to take advantage of D-Bus and 
            split its services  as a collection of distinct independant processes. The core part and some common 
            extensions have been written in Python, for taking advantage of its dynamic nature (we 
            were forced to use quite convoluted implementations in the Java version for achieving 
            the needed behaviours) and its power of expression.  
            <p>
            We could check the validity of the approach by writing an extension in Java, based on a 
            Java closed source library provided by one our our partners, and a couple of other ones 
            in C/C++ for validating the architecture. During a transitional period, we had even 
            connected the new version of the framework with a OSGi based sub-system, by writing a 
            bundle featuring a gateway between the OSGi message bus and D-Bus.
            <p>
            In addition of a greater level of freedom, we could also notice a benefit in terms of 
            system resources usage. The Python based version of the framework is far less demanding 
            in memory than the OSGi one, and its starting time is several times shorter.

            Beside making it possible to implement various parts of an application with
            the programming language of your choice, we do not enforce you to conform intrusive
            APIs.
            <p>
            We have followed the Unix philosophy : all is files. This is applied by making all manipulated data
            (configuration data, stored events,
            &hellip;) using simple, open and documented formats (tabulated text files, JSON,&hellip;).
            <p>
            We take for granted that software developers are adults and responsible people, having
            all the skills and knowledges needed to interact with the other parts of the environment
            without having to force them to go through contrived and over-designed layers of code.
            <dl>
                <dt>You need to use a shared piece of data :</dt>
                <dd>just read the files it is stored in  and work with it</dd>
                <dt>You need to produced some shared data : </dt>
                <dd>just study the format it uses, and generate your outputs in accordance.</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
            This is true for stored data, be they persistent of just for the lifespan of a run, but also
            for messages exchanged between components.

            Openness and flexibility requires an abstraction of the data and messages exchanged between
            the components making an application.
            <p>
            For not be tainted by the specificities of participating components, be they at system or at
            application level, data exchanges must take place at an abstracted level.
            <p>
            This means that while other systems are built around the concept of sensors and
            actuators, thus making intricacies such as addresses and alike surface up to the application layer,
            we have chosen to follow a different track. 
            <p>
            In practical, this translates into the fact that what circulates on the message bus to notify
            that the temperature of the bedroom is 21°C is not a message conveying the identifier or address of
            the sensor which produced the information, but a message telling that the variable
            <tt>bedroom_temperature</tt>, which is of type <tt>temperature</tt> has presently the value of
            <tt>21</tt> using the units <tt>degC</tt>. This way, if ever the sensor is broken and must be replaced
            by a brand new one using a different address, the message will still be the same and nobody else
            will ever notice the change. This is still
            true even if the new equipment is from a different manufacturer, uses a different protocol or
            communication support, or whatever else.
            <p>
            We are not the only ones to do this, but all the other solutions we have analyzed use the home
            automation paradigm for abstracting the physical resources. So what about applications having 
            nothing to do with home automation ?
            <p>
            We have stepped up one level in abstraction, and consider that an environment which is equipped
            with such devices is an instrumented system, which is observed and controlled by the mean of 
            state and control variables, these variables not being inevitably tied to physical or concrete concepts.
            <p>
            For instance, the outside temperature
            can be provided by an online weather service at a time, and be replaced by an outdoor sensor
            some time later without any effect on the consumers of the data. Same if it is provided by a physics 
            simulation program.
            <p>
            Maybe you could here again argue that the other frameworks we mentioned can do the same. 
            This is true to some extent. But consider now an application dealing with behaviors and activities
            recognition, based on physical sensors inputs correlation. Such a processing should be 
            packaged in a dedicated component, running on its own by listening to notification events pertaining
            to its concern, and producing in turn special events notifying the start and the end of the 
            activities to be monitored. This is nothing less than a <i>human behavior detector</i>. 
            How do you map such
            a sensor in available home automation oriented frameworks without using some trick to conform
            the paradigm imposed there ?
            <p>
            Of course, the principle applies the other way around for controls and commands of actuators.
            In this context, the message which will be used will contain the new value of the control variable,
            which reflects for instance the state of a power switch, the level of a dimmer,&hellip;
            <p>
            An interesting benefit of dealing with abstracted data instead of specialized commands here
            is the fact that several different command producers, be they
            physical devices or other software components of the application, can emit
            the same control message, without the controlled equipment making the difference if it does not
            care about the originator.
